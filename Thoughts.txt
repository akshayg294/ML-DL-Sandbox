We get power for three phases. Why not do this analysis seperately on all three phases?

Do we allow the possibility of multiple devices of same kind while tracking appliances in active_names? Line 329/SA_FunctionsRaycon

For different appliances in our list, we can identify waveforms of the current and compare how they vary. For the 9 observable events, their are 3 distinct waveforms. This might allow us to classify appliances more accurately than using just mean power. Also, mean power might vary significantly for the same kind of device as well.
